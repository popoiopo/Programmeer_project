# Day 1

Composed a proposal, and written a temporary appearance of the eventual visualisation.

# Day 2
Traces every map into a vector image for later use and read a LOT.

#Day 3
Made a design document, and a prototype from the vector maps created the previous day, buttons included. Sadly.. Illustrator dropped out so final work on the prototype is delayed untill tomorrow.

#Day 4 
Continued with prototype. Idea that creating a vector UI with illustrator and loading it directly in with D3 proved to work out, and functional buttons were created. Also a graph was inserted in the designated area.

#Day 5
Inserted the Hazium graph for prototype presentation.

* Wrote a temporary appearance of the eventual visualisation

## Day 2
* Traces every map into a vector image for later use 
* Read a LOT
* Wrote part of DESIGN.md

## Day 3
* Made a design document
* Made prototype from the vector maps created the previous day
* Included buttons 
* Sadly.. Illustrator dropped out so final work on the prototype is delayed untill tomorrow

## Day 4 
* Continued with prototype
* Idea that creating a vector UI with illustrator and loading it directly in with D3 proved to work out
* Functional buttons were created
* Graph was inserted in the designated area

## Day 5
* Inserted the Hazium graph for prototype presentation
* Gave and listened to presentations

# Week 1
## Day 1
* Had meeting with Gosia, changed gameplan 
* Started with basic graphs of data
* Created floor one map with two floorplan and energyzones overlapping

## Day 2
* Made the chloropleth map with actual data for floor one HVAC zones
* Looked into prox zones

## Day 3
* Created a map with dots based om prox data from the robot
* x and y coords were computed and person is placed on the map

## Day 4
* Prox data map is made interactive with a slider for all floors
* At any hour one can select a floor and see where the people are at that time

## Day 5
* Gave a presentation
* Decided what to do next week
** Combine prox data and HVAC data
** Make the two interactive with each other
** Use full dataset

# Week 2

* fixed issues with slider
* speed drastically increased with new slider
* fixed buggs in robot prox data

## Day 2
* Created heat map for prox zones
* Did some prep for next day to combine everything together

## Day 3
* Combined HVAC, prox zones, and robot coordinates
* Spent rest of the day debugging!

## Day 4
* Finished the combining of maps
* Cleaning up the code, map and everything
* Started combining visualisations with the others

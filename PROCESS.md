# Day 1

Composed a proposal, and written a temporary appearance of the eventual visualisation.

# Day 2
Traces every map into a vector image for later use and read a LOT.

#Day 3
Made a design document, and a prototype from the vector maps created the previous day, buttons included. Sadly.. Illustrator dropped out so final work on the prototype is delayed untill tomorrow.
